# Synaptic Trading — Candidate Evaluation Pack

This pack contains stubs for the AI-first evaluation.

## Contents
- `stream_stub.py` — async simulated tick stream
- `ohlcv.csv` — minute bars with gaps/outliers
- `docs/nautilus_primer.md` — correct import path and runner outline
- `docs/snippet_outdated.md` — intentionally wrong import (trap)
- `tests/template_test.py` — pytest template to extend

## Notes
- You can use AI tools, but must document **verification steps**.
- Keep Phase 1 within a **6-hour cap** (honor system).
- Provide a one-command way to run your service/tests.
